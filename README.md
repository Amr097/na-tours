# NA-Tours

Na-tours Website Built with Nextjs & Scss as a part of Jonas advanced CSS and Sass course.

## Description

This project is simply me practicing how to build modern beautiful UIs with Scss and learning how powerful CSS can be, its amazing how much i have learnt about CSS in the course period. All the web page behaviours are pure CSS. (well, Except for the navigation menu i had to actually type 3 lines of javascript to uncheck the check-box :D)

## Features

1- Responsive to all screen sizes.

2- Used responsive images to serve the right images to the right screen sizes/resolutions.

2- Images and videos are lazy loaded for better performance and less loading time.

3- Added media queries to replace hover effects on mobile screens with more-fitting visuals.

4- Tested most of the CSS properties for browser compatibility and wrote media queries to change elements styles in case a certain property is not supported.
